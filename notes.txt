IP notes

g(x) - x is p - p' where p is original pixel and p' is pixel neighbour and p - p' is the distance between these pixels
    or x is Ip - Ip' where Ip is the intensity (brightness) of the original pixel and Ip' is the intensity of the neighbour pixel
        - for greyscale, any intensity of R, G, or B can be taken. For colour images, either add up each R, G, B, intensity and take difference
	  or perform bilateral filter on each colour channel (3 times total then)

(200, 50, 150), (10, 250, 100) = (200 + 50 + 150) - (10 + 250 + 100) = intensity diff for colour imgs

3 -> (1, 1)
5 -> (2, 2)
7 -> (3, 3)
